WORD LISTS NOT INCLUDED IN REPOSITORY
=====================================

The word list files (*.gz) are not included in this GitHub repository
due to licensing restrictions.

This game uses the NASPA Word List 2023 Edition, which is licensed for
personal use only and may not be redistributed.

To build the app, you need to obtain the word lists separately and place
the following compressed files in this directory:

  01_common.gz  - Common 7-letter words list (tab-separated: WORD<tab>definition)
  02_full.gz    - Full NASPA word list (tab-separated: WORD<tab>definition)

For more information about the NASPA Word List, visit:

The word list files should be gzip-compressed text files with one word per line
in the format: WORD<tab>definition
